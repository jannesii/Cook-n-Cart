Guide to Build the Python Project into an APK Using WSL (Debian) on Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Windows 10 (version 2004 or later) or Windows 11.
- Administrator privileges on Windows.
- A stable internet connection.
- Familiarity with basic command line tools (Git, apt, etc.).

Installing WSL (if missing):
-----------------------------
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command to install WSL:
      wsl --install
   This command will enable the necessary Windows features and install WSL with the default Linux distribution.
3. To install Debian, run:
      wsl --install -d Debian
4. Restart your computer if prompted.
5. Launch Debian by either searching for "Debian" in the Start menu or by running:
      wsl -d Debian

Disclaimer:
-----------
Steps 1–5 can be completed by running the following one-liner command in your Debian terminal:
      cd && sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install git -y && git clone https://github.com/jannesii/Cook-n-Cart && cd Cook-n-Cart/ && ./build/setup-pyside6-android.sh && source .venv/bin/activate
After executing this command, proceed to Step 6 for building the APK.

Step 1: Update System Packages
-------------------------------
1. In the Debian terminal, change to your home directory:
      cd
2. Update package lists and upgrade installed packages:
      sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Git
-------------------
Install Git by running:
      sudo apt install git -y

Step 3: Clone the Project Repository
--------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
      git clone https://github.com/jannesii/Cook-n-Cart
2. Change into the project directory:
      cd Cook-n-Cart/

Step 4: Run the PySide6 Android Setup Script
---------------------------------------------
Execute the setup script:
      ./build/setup-pyside6-android.sh
   This script will:
      - Install required system packages.
      - Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
      - Install Python dependencies.
      - Clone the pyside-setup repository and download the Android NDK/SDK.
      - Clean up after the download.

Step 5: Activate the Python Virtual Environment
-------------------------------------------------
Activate the virtual environment by running:
      source .venv/bin/activate
You should now see the virtual environment’s name (typically ".venv") in your prompt.

Step 6: Build the APK
---------------------
Run the APK build script:
      ./apkBuild.sh
This command will compile your Python project and package it into an APK.

Future APK Builds:
------------------
After the initial build, if you need to rebuild the APK later:
1. Ensure that your virtual environment is activated (if not, run: 
      source .venv/bin/activate).
2. Update your project repository by running:
      git pull
3. Then, rebuild the APK by running:
      ./apkBuild.sh

Final Notes:
------------
- If you encounter errors, review the terminal output for troubleshooting hints and ensure that all dependencies are installed.
- Maintain a stable internet connection throughout the process.

Happy Building!
